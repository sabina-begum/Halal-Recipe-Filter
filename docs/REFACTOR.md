# Recipe App — Refactoring Plan

## Priority 1 — Bugs / Correctness

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Nutrition merge is broken** — last ingredient overwrites all others instead of summing | `services/nutritionAPI.ts` | Accumulate and sum each nutrient across all ingredient results |
| 2 | **`isPremium` always false** — reads `localStorage.getItem("currentUser")` which is never written; auth system writes `"demoUser"` | `components/MainLayout.tsx:67` | Replace with `useAuth()` to read premium status from `AuthContext` |
| 3 | **Mobile search does nothing** — `e.preventDefault()` only, never calls `handleSearch` | `components/Navbar.tsx` (mobile form) | Wire the mobile search form to `handleSearch` |
| 4 | **`hasUserSearched` prop accepted but unused** | `components/MainRoutes.tsx` | Remove from interface and all call sites |

---

## Priority 2 — Architecture

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 5 | **`darkMode` prop-drilled into ~65 components** — `DarkModeContext` already exists | Virtually every component | Delete `darkMode` prop; call `useDarkMode()` directly inside each component |
| 6 | **`App.tsx` is a god component** — handles routing, API calls, halal filtering, nutrition fetch, URL resolution, and toast state | `App.tsx` | Extract search + recipe-resolution logic into a `useRecipeSearch` custom hook |
| 7 | **`Home.tsx` is two pages in one** — completely different UI when `selected` is null vs. not | `features/recipes/Home.tsx` | Split into `LandingPage` (featured grid + hero) and keep the recipe-result display separate |
| 8 | **Duplicate recipe detail rendering** — both `Home.tsx` (inline result) and `RecipeDetailsSection.tsx` render the same sub-components | `Home.tsx`, `RecipeDetailsSection.tsx` | Create a shared `<RecipeDetail>` component used by both; consider eliminating the inline mode and always navigating to `/recipe/:id` |

---

## Priority 3 — Code Quality

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 9 | **Duplicate type definitions** — `Recipe`, `User`, `UserProfileData`, `NutritionGoals` defined in both `global.d.ts` and component files | `hooks/useFavorites.ts`, `components/UserProfile.tsx`, `components/NutritionTracker.tsx` | Delete local re-definitions; import from `types/global.d.ts` |
| 10 | **Loose `unknown` typing in AuthContext** — params typed as `unknown`, immediately cast to `string` | `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Type `email`, `password`, `displayName` as `string` directly |
| 11 | **`alert()` used for feedback** (8 occurrences) — `Toast` component already exists | `hooks/useFavorites.ts`, `components/RecipeReviews`, `components/PremiumFeatures`, `utils/ratingHelpers.tsx` | Replace all `alert()` calls with the existing `Toast` component |
| 12 | **`console.log` in production paths** (27+ files) — especially `nutritionAPI.ts` (12+ calls) | Various | Remove or gate behind `import.meta.env.DEV` |
| 13 | **Dead code: `getOptimizedImageUrl`** — checks WebP support but always returns the original URL | `services/performanceService.ts` | Fix or delete |
| 14 | **`window.location.href = "/"` on logo click** — triggers full page reload | `components/Navbar.tsx:198` | Replace with react-router `<Link to="/">` |

---

## Priority 4 — Large Files to Split

| File | Lines | Suggested Split |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `Navbar.tsx` | 661 | Extract `<MobileMenu>`, `<DesktopNav>`, `<UserDropdown>`, `<NotificationsBell>` — desktop and mobile dropdown JSX is currently copy-pasted verbatim |
| `NutritionTracker.tsx` | 807 | Split into `<NutritionLog>`, `<NutritionGoals>`, `<NutritionCharts>`, `<AITips>` — already has a `NutritionTracker/` subfolder ready |
| `AdvancedSearch.tsx` | 664 | Extract filter groups into `<DietaryFilters>`, `<CuisineFilter>`, `<IngredientFilter>`, `<TimeFilter>` |

---

## Priority 5 — Minor / Cleanup

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 15 | **Hardcoded Unsplash URL** in `Home.tsx:236` | Move to a constants file or env var |
| 16 | **Hardcoded `"3"` notification badge** in mobile Navbar | Drive from actual notification count |
| 17 | **Inline `style={{}}` scattered across components** | Replace with Tailwind utility classes |
| 18 | **`localStorage` keys scattered** across 15+ files | Centralise all keys in `localStorageHelpers.ts` as named constants; use consistently |
| 19 | **Language switcher is a stub** with no i18n behind it | Either wire up `react-i18next` or remove the UI until implemented |
| 20 | **`SecurityWrapper` cosmetic-only** — client-side token / rate-limit provides no real security | Remove or clearly mark as UX-only; move real security to server |

## Quick Wins (do first, lowest effort / highest impact)

1. Remove `darkMode` prop from all components → call `useDarkMode()` directly *(one sweep, huge noise reduction)*
2. Fix `isPremium` to use `useAuth()` *(1 line fix, actual bug)*
3. Fix mobile search form submit *(2 lines, actual bug)*
4. Fix nutrition sum logic in `nutritionAPI.ts` *(~10 lines, functional bug)*
5. Replace all `alert()` with `Toast` *(8 call sites, improves UX)*
6. Remove duplicate type definitions *(delete lines, no breakage)*
